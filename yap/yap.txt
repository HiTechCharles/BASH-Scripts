Yahtzee Automation Program  (YAP) by Charles Martin  <HiTechCharles@gmail.com>

What is yap?  
============ 
YAP is a program that will keep track of scores
for the game Yahtzee.  YAP saves you time by adding scores, always knowing
whose turn it is, showing the leader of the pack at the touch of a button,
and it runs on anything bash will run on.

YAP is easy to follow.   On each player's turn, just choose a category and
input how many points.  The YAP will figure out the scores, which scoring
categories are available, and how many turns each player has taken.


Why does it not roll dice?  
========================== 
This program was made for situations where you've got a bunch of guys and
gals in one room.  While you play the game, you can talk plenty, drink 
plenty, and enjoy each other's company.  Why use a computer?  One is 
usually nearby, it's always a fair game since accurate scores and player
turn are kept.  Also the current game is saved to disk after each turn
for recovery after a computer crash or when you want to finish the game
later.


How to Run it 
============= 
After downloading the gzip archive containing the program, go into a 
terminal and change to the directory containing the download like this:
	cd ~/Downloads

Next, extract the archive with
	tar -xvf yap-1.0.tar.gz

After extraction, you will see a new directory called yap.  Get into this
directory with
	cd yap

Finally, run the program by issuing the command with all names of players
with spaces between the command and each name.
	./yap Charles Tiffany Jackie

The game is now running!


How to use it 
============= 
Once YAP starts, the program will introduce itself, and show the order for 
the players.  Just press a key here to continue.  If names were not supplied
on the command line, YAP will get the player names first.

On each player's turn, the screen and options stay the same.  Only the scoring
categories will dissappear as they are used.  At the top, the current player's
name, score, and turns remaining is displayed.	Following this, a list of
keys and remaining categories appear.  At the end, a few options are given.

To score, just press the letter or number next to the category that the
player wants to use.  You will be prompted for the number of points gained.
Zero is allowed as well.  Type the number of points and hit ENTER.  To pick a
different category to score, just press ENTER with no input to allow choosing
a different scoring area.

For Full house, the straights, and yahtzee, you either score the full amount
of points or zero.  For these, press F to score full points, z for zero,
or C to cancel the category selection and try again.

After scoring, the value for the category chosen, as well as total points
are printed.  Press any key to go to the next player's turn.

At the start of any player's turn, you can press A to see all scores, P to
see your score card, or Q to exit the program.	When exiting, your game is
saved for next time.


End of the game =============== When all participants have filled in all of
their categories, the game ends.  The final scores are given, and the winner
is announced.  Total wins for each player are kept to show who has won the
most games.

Files ===== 
All YAP files are stored in your home directory under .yap.
The recovery directory contains data used to recover the current game in
progress.  The winners file keeps track of how many wins for each player
that has won.
